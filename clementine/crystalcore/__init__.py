"""
CrystalCore — the sovereign companion framework.

CrystalCore is the engine: layered memory, semantic recall, profiles,
personality, and a local-model connection — everything a sovereign,
locally-run companion needs, with nothing leaving the device.

Clementine is the first persona who lives on it (and the default one
shipped here). Your human may rename her; the framework doesn't mind.
